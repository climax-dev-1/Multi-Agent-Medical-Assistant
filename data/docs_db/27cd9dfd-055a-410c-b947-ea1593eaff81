## Adjunct therapies

- · Immunotherapy or biotherapy activates the immune system (T-cells and antibodies) to destroy cancer cells. Experimental research is exploring ways to prevent or treat cancer through vaccines.
- · Gene therapy uses viruses or other vectors to introduce new genetic material into tumor cells. This experimental therapy can cause tumor cells to die or increase their susceptibility to other cancer therapies.
- · Hyperbaric oxygen uses oxygen at higher than normal levels to promote wound healing and help fight infection. It may also improve the tumor's responsiveness to radiation and is being studied experimentally. Currently it is being used to help the body naturally remove dead tumor cells and treat radiation necrosis.

Figure 5. The radiation beam is shaped to match the tumor and minimize exposure to normal brain tissue. The colored rings represent the radiation dose level.

picture_counter_6 The image is an axial MRI scan of a human brain, specifically slice number 18. It shows a highlighted region in the brain with multiple concentric contours, indicating different radiation dose levels in Gy (Gray units) used in treatment planning. The color-coded dose levels are represented as follows: 9.00 Gy (green), 16.00 Gy (yellow), 32.00 Gy (red), and 100.0% x 20.00 Gy (cyan). There is a small color legend at the bottom right corner, and a 3D model of the brain at the bottom left corner, indicating the orientation of the slice. The image is related to the context of medical research, likely involving the use of AI or imaging techniques in diagnosing or planning treatment for brain conditions.


## Clinical trials

Clinical trials are research studies in which new treatments-drugs, diagnostics, procedures, and other therapies-are tested in people to see if they are safe and effective. Research is always being conducted to improve the standard of medical care. Information about current clinical trials, including eligibility, protocol, and locations, are found on the Web. Studies can be sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (see clinicaltrials.gov) as well as private industry and pharmaceutical companies (see www.centerwatch.com).
