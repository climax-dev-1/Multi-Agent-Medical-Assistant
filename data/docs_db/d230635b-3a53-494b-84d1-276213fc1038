## Surgery

Surgery is the treatment of choice for brain tumors that can be reached without causing significant injury to vital parts of the brain (eloquent tissue). Surgery can help to refine the diagnosis, remove as much of the tumor as possible, and release pressure within the skull caused by the tumor. A neurosurgeon performs a craniotomy to open the

There is also an inset showing three test tubes with varying levels of a substance, possibly illustrating a step-by-step process or comparison. The brain illustration is detailed, highlighting the affected region. This image is relevant to medical research or techniques in diagnosing and treating brain conditions.

skull and remove the tumor. Sometimes only part of the tumor is removed if it is near critical areas of the brain. A partial removal can still relieve symptoms. Radiation or chemotherapy may be used on the remaining tumor cells.

Improvements in techniques, particularly imageguided surgery, intraoperative MRI/CT, and functional brain mapping have improved the surgeon's ability to precisely locate the tumor, define the tumor's borders, avoid injury to vital brain areas, and confirm the amount of tumor removal while in the operating room.


## Radiation

at brain tumors. Radiation works by damaging Radiation therapy uses controlled high-energy rays to tre the DNA inside cells making them unable to divide and reproduce. The goal of radiation therapy is to maximize the dose to abnormal cells and minimize exposure to normal cells (Fig. 5). The benefits of radiation are not immediate but occur over time. Aggressive tumors, whose cells divide rapidly, typically respond more quickly to radiation. There are two ways to deliver radiation, external and internal beams.

xternal beam radiation is delivered from outside he body by a machine that aims high-energy rays x-rays, gamma rays) at the tumor. E t (

- · Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) delivers a high dose of radiation during a single session. Although it is called surgery, no incision is made.
- · Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSR) delivers lower doses of radiation over many visits. Patients return daily over several weeks to receive the complete radiation dose.
- · Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) delivers the radiation dose to the entire brain. It is often used to treat multiple brain tumors and metastases.

Internal radiation (brachytherapy) is delivered from nside the body by surgically placing radioactive material (sealed in catheters, seeds, or balloons) irectly into the tumor. After the patient undergoes a craniotomy to remove the tumor, the radioactive material is placed inside the tumor cavity. The radiation dose is delivered to the first few millimeters of tissue that surrounded the tumor avity where malignant cells may still remain. Patients have no risk of radiation injury to other parts of their own body or to others around them because the radiation dose is precisely delivered and short lived. i d c


## Chemotherapy

hemotherapy drugs work by interrupting cell division. However, it affects not only tumor cells but ormal cells, thus causing side effects, especially in ast growing cells (e.g., hair, digestive, blood). reatment is delivered in cycles with rest periods in etween to allow the body to rebuild healthy cells. hemotherapy drugs can be administered orally as pill, intravenously (IV), or as a wafer placed urgically into the tumor. The drugs most ommonly used to treat brain tumors are armustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU), and emozolomide (Temodar). Chemotherapy is also sed as a radio-sensitizing agent that increases umor cell death during radiation therapy. Agents hat often work in high-grade gliomas include rocarbazine, platinum analogs (cisplatin, arboplatin), the nitrosureas (BCNU, CCNU), and lkylating agents (temozolomide, vincristine). BCNU as been proven effective when applied locally to he tumor bed after the tumor has been removed. y applying it directly to the diseased area of the rain, side effects are limited and the drug has a outinely used for benign tumors.
