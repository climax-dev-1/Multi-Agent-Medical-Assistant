## Multi-layer CNN

First, we need to determine the architecture of our model. The input form of our data is 400 × 400 and has 3 channels. Since we have a total of 4 different classes, the number of output classes is set to 4. Our model has a structure that includes convolutional and pooling layers. First, there is a 3 × 3 convolutional layer with 32 filters. This is followed by a 2 × 2 max pooling layer. This reduces the size by emphasizing lower-level features. To deepen our model, this structure is repeated twice, adding convolutional layers with 64 and 128 filters, respectively, and maximum pooling layers of size 2 × 2.

The resulting feature map is transformed into a flat vector with a flattening layer. A hidden (dense) layer of 128 neurons is then added. This layer deepens the learned features and increases generalization. Finally, the output layer has 4 neurons and calculates the probabilities between classes with the softmax activation function. To train our model, we need to determine the optimal function and metrics. In this paper, we use the Rectified Adam optimization algorithm. This algorithm dynamically adjusts the learning rate and helps to use gradients more efficiently. Also, categorical cross-entropy is used as the loss function during training, as it is widely used in multiclass classification task.

The metrics tracked during training are accuracy, as well as precision and recall. These metrics are important for evaluating the classification performance of the model. In addition, a reduced learning rate recall (ReduceLROnPlateau) is used to dynamically adjust the learning rate. This recall reduces the learning rate when the loss function flattens out during the training process, resulting in more stable training. The epoch is set to 14 and the batch size to 10.


## CNN-based transfer learning

In transfer learning architectures, all parameters and layers outside the model are the same, but after the last 3 layers of transfer learning models are removed, layers unique to the dataset are added instead: the GlobalAveragePooling2D layer contains fewer parameters than the Flatten layer, which reduces the risk of overfitting and helps build a more efficient model. Also, while the Flatten layer is used to organize the data, the GlobalAveragePooling2D layer is used for feature extraction, making the network learning process more efficient.

Due to the fact that the training data tends to learn very fast compared to the validation data, we modified the ratio of the dropout layers in the original architectures. For all models, the dilution rate was set to 0.05. During the model training process, the designated optimizer was "RectifiedAdam", with the optimizer parameters configured as follows: learning\_rate = 0.0001, beta\_1 = 0.9, beta\_2 = 0.999, and epsilon = 1e-08. The loss function selected is categorical\_crossentropy, while the metrics used include precision, recall, categorical accuracy, and accuracy. This completes the pre-training of the model. The final layer of the model is the dense layer, which contains 4 neurons, which is usually the number of output classes in classification problems. The activation function of this layer is "softmax". The softmax function makes the output values interpretable as probabilities between classes. Furthermore, the data type of this layer is "float64", which means that the output values are of a 64-bit double precision type. The layer also applies regularization using the "kernel\_regularizer" property. The L2 regularization used here aims to reduce the risk of overfitting by limiting the size of the weights. The regularization coefficient of 0.1, denoted by "regulars. l2 (0.1)", controls the effectiveness of the regularization.

During the model training process, the "ReduceLROnPlateau" function of the Keras library was used as a backpropagation algorithm. This function automatically reduced the learning rate when the model approached a local optimum or when the loss value did not decrease. The parameters of the "ReduceLROnPlateau" function are as follows monitor: The metric monitored is usually "val\_loss" (validation loss). This is the metric used to determine if the learning rate should be reduced:

- · patience: The expected patience time for lowering the learning rate, i.e. how long the metric should not improve.
- · factor: The factor used to reduce the learning rate. For example, a value of 0.3 reduces the learning rate by 30%.
- · min\_lr: Specifies the minimum achievable learning rate. This limits the learning rate without making it infinitesimal.

Using this feature allows for more stable and efficient model training, streamlining the process of fine-tuning training parameters without the need to manually adjust the learning rate. The training program was run over 14 epochs with batches of size 10. Details of the multilayer CNN model used in the study are presented in Fig. 2, which outlines its architectural features.

The training and validation accuracy loss graphs of the models created with VGG19, EfficientNetB4, InceptionV3 transfer learning, and CNN are shown in Fig. 3.
