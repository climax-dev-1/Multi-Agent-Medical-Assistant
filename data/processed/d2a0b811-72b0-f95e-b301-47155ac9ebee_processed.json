Normal cells grow in a controlled manner as new cells replace old or damaged ones. For reasons not fully understood, tumor cells reproduce uncontrollably. Brain tumors are named after the cell type from which they grow. They may be primary (starting in the brain) or secondary (spreading to the brain from another area). Treatment options vary depending on the tumor type, size and location; whether the tumor has spread; and the age and medical health of the person. Treatment options may be curative or focus on relieving symptoms. Of the more than 120 types of brain tumors, many can be successfully treated. New therapies are improving the life span and quality of life for many people. What is a brain tumor? A primary brain tumor is an abnormal growth that starts in the brain and usually does not spread to other parts of the body. Primary brain tumors may be benign or malignant. A benign brain tumor grows slowly, has distinct boundaries, and rarely spreads. Although its cells are not malignant, this tumor composed of benign cells and located in vital areas can be considered life-threatening. A malignant brain tumor grows quickly, has irregular boundaries, and spreads to nearby brain areas. Although they are sometimes called brain cancer, malignant brain tumors do not fit the definition of cancer because they do not spread to organs outside the brain and spinal cord. Metastatic (secondary) brain tumors begin as cancer elsewhere in the body and spread to the brain. They form when cancer cells are carried in the blood stream to the brain. The most common cancers that spread to the brain are lung and breast. Whether a brain tumor is benign, malignant, or metastatic, all are potentially life-threatening. Enclosed within the bony skull, the brain cannot expand to make room for a growing mass. As a result, the tumor compresses and displaces normal brain tissue (Fig. 1). Some brain tumors cause a blockage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that flows around and through the brain. This blockage increases intracranial pressure and can enlarge the ventricles (hydrocephalus). Some brain tumors cause swelling (edema). Size, pressure, and swelling all create \"mass effect,\" which cause many of the symptoms. Types of brain tumors There are over 120 different types of brain tumors. Common brain tumors include: Gliomas \u2022 Astrocytoma o Pilocytic Astrocytoma (grade I) o Diffuse Astrocytoma (grade II) o Anaplastic Astrocytoma (grade III) o Glioblastoma Multiforme (grade IV) \u2022 Oligodendroglioma (grade II) o Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma (grade III) \u2022 Ependymoma (grade II) o Anaplastic Ependymoma (grade III) Brain Tumors: an Introduction basic level Figure 1.

Tumors are classified by their cell type and grade by viewing the cells, usually taken during a biopsy, under a microscope. \u2022 Cell type. Refers to the cell of origin of the tumor. For example, nerve cells (neurons) and support cells (glial and schwann cells) give rise to tumors. About half of all primary brain tumors grow from glial cells (gliomas). There are many types of gliomas because there are different kinds of glial cells. \u2022 Grade . Refers to the way tumor cells look under the microscope and is an indication of aggressiveness (e.g., low grade means least aggressive and high grade means most aggressive) (Table 1). Tumors often have a mix of cell grades and can change as they grow. Differentiated and anaplastic are terms used to describe how similar or abnormal the tumor cells appear compared to normal cells. Table 1. Glioma Grading Scale . Grade Characteristics I Slow growing cells Almost normal appearance Least malignant Usually associated with long-term survival II Relatively slow growing cells Slightly abnormal appearance Can invade nearby tissue Sometimes recur as a higher grade III Actively reproducing abnormal cells Abnormal appearance Infiltrate normal tissue Tend to recur, often as a higher grade IV Rapidly reproducing abnormal cells Very abnormal appearance Area of dead cells (necrosis) in center Form new blood vessels to maintain growth What causes brain tumors? Medical science neither knows what causes brain tumors nor how to prevent primary tumors that start in the brain. People most at risk for brain tumors include those who have: \u2022 cancer elsewhere in the body \u2022 prolonged exposure to pesticides, industrial solvents, and other chemicals \u2022 inherited diseases, such as neurofibromatosis Figure 2. Brain tumor symptoms are related to the functional areas of the brain, giving doctors clues as to the tumor location. Frontal lobe tumors may cause: \u2022 Behavioral and emotional changes \u2022 Impaired judgment \u2022 Impaired sense of smell \u2022 Memory loss \u2022 Paralysis on one side of the body \u2022 Reduced mental abilities \u2022 Vision loss Parietal lobe tumors may cause: \u2022 Impaired speech \u2022 Inability to write \u2022 Lack of recognition \u2022 Spatial disorders Occipital lobe tumors may cause: \u2022 Vision loss in one or both eyes Temporal lobe tumors may cause: \u2022 Impaired speech \u2022 Memory difficulty Brainstem tumors may cause: \u2022 Behavioral and emotional changes \u2022 Difficulty speaking and swallowing \u2022 Drowsiness \u2022 Hearing loss \u2022 Muscle weakness on one side of the face (e.g., head tilt, crooked smile) \u2022 Muscle weakness on one side of the body \u2022 Uncoordinated gait \u2022 Drooping eyelid or double vision \u2022 Vomiting Pituitary gland tumors may cause: \u2022 Increased secretion of hormones (Cushing\u2019s Disease, acromegaly) \u2022 A stop in menstruation \u2022 Abnormal secretion of milk \u2022 Decreased libido --- Page 3 --- > 3", "metadata": {"source": "brain_tumors_ucni.pdf", "file_type": "pdf", "num_pages": 7, "creationdate": "D:20100301162453-05'00'", "author": "Tonya Hines", "creator": "Word: cgpdftops CUPS filter", "producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.2.0 (Macintosh)", "moddate": "D:20100301162519-05'00'", "title": "Microsoft Word - PE-BrainTumors_UCNI.doc", "medical_entities": ["cancer"], "chunk_number": 1, "total_chunks": 9, "section": "general"}}, {"id": "d2a0b811-72b0-f95e-b301-471500000002", "content": "weakness on one side of the body \u2022 Uncoordinated gait \u2022 Drooping eyelid or double vision \u2022 Vomiting Pituitary gland tumors may cause: \u2022 Increased secretion of hormones (Cushing\u2019s Disease, acromegaly) \u2022 A stop in menstruation \u2022 Abnormal secretion of milk \u2022 Decreased libido --- Page 3 --- > 3 What are the symptoms? Tumors can affect the brain by destroying normal tissue, compressing normal tissue, or increasing intracranial pressure. Symptoms vary depending on the tumor\u2019s type, size, and location in the brain (Fig. 2). General symptoms include: \u2022 headaches that tend to worsen in the morning \u2022 seizures \u2022 stumbling, dizziness, difficulty walking \u2022 speech problems (e.g., difficulty finding the right word) \u2022 vision problems, abnormal eye movements \u2022 weakness on one side of the body \u2022 increased intracranial pressure, which causes drowsiness, headaches, nausea and vomiting, sluggish responses Who is affected? The American Brain Tumor Association estimates that about 40,900 people will be diagnosed with a primary brain tumor in the US this year (rate of 14 per 100,000 people). Metastatic (secondary) brain tumors are more common than primary brain tumors by at least 10 to 1, and they occur in 20% to 40% of cancer patients. The exact number of brain metastases is unknown, but it has been estimated that 98,000 to 170,000 new cases are diagnosed in the US each year. Unfortunately, each year about 12,690 people die of brain tumors in the US. Although brain tumors can occur at any age, they are most common in children 3 to 12 years old and in adults 40 to 70 years old. How is a diagnosis made? First, the doctor will obtain your personal and family medical history and perform a complete physical examination. In addition to checking your general health, the doctor performs a neurological exam to check mental status and memory, cranial nerve function (sight, hearing, smell, tongue and facial movement), muscle strength, coordination, reflexes, and response to pain. Additional tests may include: \u2022 Audiometry, a hearing test performed by an audiologist, detects hearing loss due to tumors near the cochlear nerve (e.g., acoustic neuroma). \u2022 An endocrine evaluation measures hormone levels in your blood or urine to detect abnormal levels caused by pituitary tumors (e.g., Cushing\u2019s Disease). \u2022 A visual field acuity test is performed by a neuro-ophthalmologist to detect vision loss and missing areas in your field of view. \u2022 A lumbar puncture (spinal tap) may be performed to examine cerebrospinal fluid for tumor cells, proteins, infection, and blood. Imaging tests \u2022 Computed Tomography (CT) scan is a safe, noninvasive test that uses an X-ray beam and a computer to make 2-dimensional images of the brain. Similar to an MRI, it views the brain in slices, layer-by-layer, taking a picture of each slice. A dye (contrast agent) may be injected into your bloodstream. CT is especially useful for viewing changes in bony structures. \u2022 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan is a noninvasive test that uses a magnetic field and radiofrequency waves to give a detailed view of the soft tissues of the brain. It views", "metadata": {"source": "brain_tumors_ucni.pdf", "file_type": "pdf", "num_pages": 7, "creationdate": "D:20100301162453-05'00'", "author": "Tonya Hines", "creator": "Word: cgpdftops CUPS filter", "producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.2.0 (Macintosh)", "moddate": "D:20100301162519-05'00'", "title": "Microsoft Word - PE-BrainTumors_UCNI.doc", "medical_entities": ["cancer"], "chunk_number": 2, "total_chunks": 9, "section": "general"}}, {"id": "d2a0b811-72b0-f95e-b301-471500000003", "content": "(contrast agent) may be injected into your bloodstream. CT is especially useful for viewing changes in bony structures. \u2022 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan is a noninvasive test that uses a magnetic field and radiofrequency waves to give a detailed view of the soft tissues of the brain. It views the brain 3-dimensionally in slices that can be taken from the side or from the top as a cross- section. A dye (contrast agent) may be injected into your bloodstream. MRI is very useful to evaluate brain lesions and their effects on surrounding brain (Fig. 3). Biopsy In some cases, if a diagnosis cannot be made clearly from the scans, a biopsy may be performed to determine what type of tumor is present. Biopsy is a procedure to remove a small amount of tumor to be examined by a pathologist under a microscope. A biopsy can be taken as part of an open surgical procedure to remove the tumor or as a separate diagnostic procedure, known as a needle biopsy via a small hole drilled in the skull. A hollow needle is guided into the tumor and a tissue sample is removed (Fig. 4). A stereotactic biopsy is like a needle biopsy but is performed with the use of a stereotactic head frame and a computer to precisely locate the tumor and direct the needle. This more complex procedure is used for deep tumors in critical locations. Benign Malignant Figure 3. MRI scans of a benign and malignant brain tumor. Benign tumors have well defined edges and are more easily removed surgically. Malignant tumors have an irregular border that invades normal tissue with finger-like projections making surgical removal more difficult. --- Page 4 --- > 4 Who treats brain tumors? Because there are so many kinds of brain tumors and some are complex to treat, many doctors may be involved in your care. Your team may include a neurosurgeon, oncologist, radiation oncologist, radiologist, neurologist, and neuro-ophthalmologist. What treatments are available? Treatment options vary depending on the type, grade, size and location of the tumor; whether it has spread; and your age and general health. The goal of treatment may be curative or focus on relieving symptoms (palliative care). Treatments are often used in combination with one another. The goal is to remove all or as much of the tumor as possible through surgery to minimize the chance of recurrence. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are used to treat tumors that cannot be removed by surgery alone. For example, surgery may remove the bulk of the tumor and a small amount of residual tumor near a critical structure can later be treated with radiation. Observation Sometimes the best treatment is observation. For example, benign, slow growing tumors that are small and have few symptoms may be observed with routine MRI scans every year until their growth or symptoms necessitate surgery. Observation may be the best option for older patients with other health conditions. Medication Medications are used to control some of the common side effects of brain tumors. \u2022 Corticosteroid medications, such as dexamethasone", "metadata": {"source": "brain_tumors_ucni.pdf", "file_type": "pdf", "num_pages": 7, "creationdate": "D:20100301162453-05'00'", "author": "Tonya Hines", "creator": "Word: cgpdftops CUPS filter", "producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.2.0 (Macintosh)", "moddate": "D:20100301162519-05'00'", "title": "Microsoft Word - PE-BrainTumors_UCNI.doc", "medical_entities": ["cancer"], "chunk_number": 3, "total_chunks": 9, "section": "general"}}, {"id": "d2a0b811-72b0-f95e-b301-471500000004", "content": "may be observed with routine MRI scans every year until their growth or symptoms necessitate surgery. Observation may be the best option for older patients with other health conditions. Medication Medications are used to control some of the common side effects of brain tumors. \u2022 Corticosteroid medications, such as dexamethasone (Decadron), are prescribed to reduce swelling and inflammation around the tumor. Because steroid medications can cause stomach ulcers and gastric reflux, famotidine (Pepcid) or pantoprazole (Protonix) are prescribed to reduce the amount of acid produced in the stomach. \u2022 Furosemide (Lasix) or mannitol (Osmitrol) may be used to control edema and intracranial pressure. \u2022 Anticonvulsant medications are used to prevent or control seizures. The most common ones include phenytoin (Dilantin), valproic acid (Depakote), carbamazepine (Tegretol), and levetiracetam (Keppra). Surgery Surgery is the treatment of choice for brain tumors that can be reached without causing significant injury to vital parts of the brain (eloquent tissue). Surgery can help to refine the diagnosis, remove as much of the tumor as possible, and release pressure within the skull caused by the tumor. A neurosurgeon performs a craniotomy to open the skull and remove the tumor. Sometimes only part of the tumor is removed if it is near critical areas of the brain. A partial removal can still relieve symptoms. Radiation or chemotherapy may be used on the remaining tumor cells. Improvements in techniques, particularly image- guided surgery, intraoperative MRI/CT, and functional brain mapping have improved the surgeon\u2019s ability to precisely locate the tumor, define the tumor\u2019s borders, avoid injury to vital brain areas, and confirm the amount of tumor removal while in the operating room. Radiation Radiation therapy uses controlled high-energy rays to treat brain tumors. Radiation works by damaging the DNA inside cells making them unable to divide and reproduce. The goal of radiation therapy is to maximize the dose to abnormal cells and minimize exposure to normal cells (Fig. 5). The benefits of radiation are not immediate but occur over time. Aggressive tumors, whose cells divide rapidly, typically respond more quickly to radiation. There are two ways to deliver radiation, external and internal beams. Figure 4. During a needle biopsy, a hollow cannula is inserted into the tumor. Small biting instruments remove bits of tumor for the pathologist to examine and determine the exact tumor cell type. --- Page 5 --- > 5 External beam radiation is delivered from outside the body by a machine that aims high-energy rays (x-rays, gamma rays) at the tumor. \u2022 Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) delivers a high dose of radiation during a single session. Although it is called surgery, no incision is made. \u2022 Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSR) delivers lower doses of radiation over many visits. Patients return daily over several weeks to receive the complete radiation dose. \u2022 Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) delivers the radiation dose to the entire brain. It is often used to treat multiple brain tumors and metastases. Internal radiation (brachytherapy) is delivered from inside the body by surgically placing radioactive material (sealed in catheters, seeds, or balloons) directly into the tumor.

It is often used to treat multiple brain tumors and metastases. Internal radiation (brachytherapy) is delivered from inside the body by surgically placing radioactive material (sealed in catheters, seeds, or balloons) directly into the tumor. After the patient undergoes a craniotomy to remove the tumor, the radioactive material is placed inside the tumor cavity. The radiation dose is delivered to the first few millimeters of tissue that surrounded the tumor cavity where malignant cells may still remain. Patients have no risk of radiation injury to other parts of their own body or to others around them because the radiation dose is precisely delivered and short lived. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy drugs work by interrupting cell division. However, it affects not only tumor cells but normal cells, thus causing side effects, especially in fast growing cells (e.g., hair, digestive, blood). Treatment is delivered in cycles with rest periods in between to allow the body to rebuild healthy cells. Chemotherapy drugs can be administered orally as a pill, intravenously (IV), or as a wafer placed surgically into the tumor. The drugs most commonly used to treat brain tumors are carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU), and temozolomide (Temodar). Chemotherapy is also used as a radio-sensitizing agent that increases tumor cell death during radiation therapy. Agents that often work in high-grade gliomas include procarbazine, platinum analogs (cisplatin, carboplatin), the nitrosureas (BCNU, CCNU), and alkylating agents (temozolomide, vincristine). BCNU has been proven effective when applied locally to the tumor bed after the tumor has been removed. By applying it directly to the diseased area of the brain, side effects are limited and the drug has a more beneficial effect. Chemotherapy is not routinely used for benign tumors. Adjunct therapies \u2022 Immunotherapy or biotherapy activates the immune system (T-cells and antibodies) to destroy cancer cells. Experimental research is exploring ways to prevent or treat cancer through vaccines. \u2022 Gene therapy uses viruses or other vectors to introduce new genetic material into tumor cells. This experimental therapy can cause tumor cells to die or increase their susceptibility to other cancer therapies. \u2022 Hyperbaric oxygen uses oxygen at higher than normal levels to promote wound healing and help fight infection. It may also improve the tumor\u2019s responsiveness to radiation and is being studied experimentally. Currently it is being used to help the body naturally remove dead tumor cells and treat radiation necrosis. Clinical trials Clinical trials are research studies in which new treatments\u2014drugs, diagnostics, procedures, and other therapies\u2014are tested in people to see if they are safe and effective. Research is always being conducted to improve the standard of medical care. Information about current clinical trials, including eligibility, protocol, and locations, are found on the Web. Studies can be sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (see clinicaltrials.gov) as well as private industry and pharmaceutical companies (see www.centerwatch.com).

The radiation beam is shaped to match the tumor and minimize exposure to normal brain tissue. The colored rings represent the radiation dose level. --- Page 6 --- > 6 Driving privileges may be suspended while taking anticonvulsant medication. As each state has different rules about driving and seizures, discuss this issue with your doctor. It may also be appropriate to discuss advance medical directives (e.g., living will, health care proxy, durable power of attorney) with your family to ensure your medical care and wishes are followed. Rehabilitation Because brain tumors develop in parts of the brain that control movement, speech, vision and thinking, rehabilitation may be a necessary part of recovery. Although the brain can sometimes heal itself after the trauma of treatment, it will take time and patience. A neuropsychologist can help patients evaluate changes caused by their brain tumor and develop a plan for rehabilitation. A neuropsych- ological evaluation assesses the patient's emotional state, daily behavior, cognitive (mental) abilities, and personality. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy may be helpful to improve or correct lost functions. Recurrence How well a tumor will respond to treatment, remain in remission, or recur after treatment depends on the specific tumor type and location. A recurrent tumor may be a tumor that still persists after treatment, one that grows back some time after treatment destroyed it, or a new tumor that grows in the same place as the original one. When a brain tumor is in remission, the tumor cells have stopped growing or multiplying. Periods of remission vary. In general, benign tumors recur less often than malignant ones. Since it is impossible to predict whether or when a particular tumor may recur, lifelong monitoring with MRI or CT scans is essential for people treated for a brain tumor, even a benign lesion. Follow-up scans may be performed every 3 to 6 months or annually, depending on the type of tumor you had.
