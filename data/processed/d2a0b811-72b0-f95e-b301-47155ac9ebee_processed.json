Normal cells grow in a controlled manner \nas new cells replace old or damaged ones. For reasons not fully understood, tumor cells reproduce \nuncontrollably. Brain tumors are named after the cell type from \nwhich they grow. They may be primary (starting in \nthe brain) or secondary (spreading to the brain \nfrom another area). Treatment options vary depending on the tumor type, size and location; \nwhether the tumor has spread; and the age and \nmedical health of the person. Treatment options \nmay be curative or focus on relieving symptoms. Of \nthe more than 120 types of brain tumors, many can \nbe successfully treated. New therapies are \nimproving the life span and quality of life for many people. What is a brain tumor? A primary brain tumor  is an abnormal growth \nthat starts in the brain and usually does not spread to other parts of the body. Primary brain tumors \nmay be benign or malignant. A benign  brain tumor grows slowly, has \ndistinct boundaries, and rarely spreads. Although its cells are not malignant, this tumor \ncomposed of benign cells and located in vital areas can be considered life-threatening. A malignant  brain tumor grows quickly, has \nirregular boundaries, and spreads to nearby \nbrain areas. Although they are sometimes \ncalled brain cancer, malignant brain tumors do \nnot fit the definition of cancer because they do not spread to organs outside the brain and \nspinal cord. Metastatic (secondary) brain tumors  begin as \ncancer elsewhere in the body and spread to the brain. They form when cancer cells are carried in \nthe blood stream to the brain. The most common \ncancers that spread to the brain are lung and \nbreast. Whether a brain tumor is benign, malignant, or \nmetastatic, all are potentially life-threatening. Enclosed within the bony skull, the brain cannot expand to make room for a growing mass. As a \nresult, the tumor compresses and displaces normal \nbrain tissue (Fig. 1). Some brain tumors cause a \nblockage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that flows \naround and through the brain. This blockage \nincreases intracranial pressure and can enlarge the \nventricles (hydrocephalus).", "metadata": {"source": "brain_tumors_ucni.pdf", "file_type": "pdf", "num_pages": 7, "creationdate": "D:20100301162453-05'00'", "author": "Tonya Hines", "creator": "Word: cgpdftops CUPS filter", "producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.2.0 (Macintosh)", "moddate": "D:20100301162519-05'00'", "title": "Microsoft Word - PE-BrainTumors_UCNI.doc", "medical_entities": {"diseases": ["cancer"], "procedures": ["biopsy", "surgery", "x-ray"], "anatomy": ["stomach", "brain", "bone", "muscle", "liver", "pituitary", "lung", "nerve"]}, "document_type": "clinical_note", "processing_timestamp": "2025-03-22T23:48:11.721892", "chunk_number": 0, "total_chunks": 10, "section": "sliding_window", "hierarchy_level": "sliding", "importance_score": 0.3630434782608696, "word_count": 368, "chunking_strategy": "hybrid", "next_chunk_id": "d2a0b811-72b0-f95e-b301-471500000001"}}, {"id": "d2a0b811-72b0-f95e-b301-471500000001", "content": "Some brain tumors cause a \nblockage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that flows \naround and through the brain.

Tumors are classified by \ntheir cell type and grade by viewing the cells, usually taken during a biopsy, under a microscope. \u2022 Cell type. Refers to the cell of origin of the \ntumor. For example, nerve cells (neurons) and \nsupport cells (glial and schwann cells) give rise to tumors. About half of all primary brain \ntumors grow from glial cells (gliomas). There \nare many types of gliomas because there are \ndifferent kinds of glial cells. \u2022 Grade . Refers to the way tumor cells look \nunder the microscope and is an indication of \naggressiveness (e.g., low grade means least aggressive and high grade means most \naggressive) (Table 1). Tumors often have a mix \nof cell grades and can change as they grow.

Tumors can affect the brain by destroying normal tissue, compressing normal tissue, or increasing intracranial pressure. Symptoms vary depending on\n \nthe tumor\u2019s type, size, and location in the brain (Fig. 2). General symptoms include:  \n \n\u2022 headaches that tend to worsen in the morning \n\u2022 seizures  \n\u2022 stumbling, dizziness, difficulty walking \n\u2022 speech problems (e.g., difficulty finding the \nright word)  \n\u2022 vision problems, abnormal eye movements \n\u2022 weakness on one side of the body \n\u2022 increased intracranial pressure, which causes \ndrowsiness, headaches, nausea and vomiting, \nsluggish responses \n \nWho is affected? The American Brain Tumor Association estimates that about 40,900 people will be diagnosed with a \nprimary brain tumor in the US this year (rate of 14\n \nper 100,000 people). Metastatic (secondary) brain tumors are more common than primary brain \ntumors by at least 10 to 1, and they occur in 20% \nto 40% of cancer patients. The exact number of \nbrain metastases is unknown, but it has been estimated that 98,000 to 170,000 new cases are \ndiagnosed in the US each year. Unfortunately, each\n \nyear about 12,690 people die of brain tumors in the  \nUS. Although brain tumors can occur at any age, \nthey are most common in children 3 to 12 years old  \nand in adults 40 to 70 years old. How is a diagnosis made? First, the doctor will obtain your personal and family medical history and perform a complete \nphysical examination. In addition to checking your \ngeneral health, the doctor performs a neurological exam to check mental status and memory, cranial \nnerve function (sight, hearing, smell, tongue and \nfacial movement), muscle strength, coordination, \nreflexes, and response to pain. Additional tests may\n \ninclude:  \n\u2022 Audiometry, a hearing test performed by an \naudiologist, detects hearing loss due to tumors\n \nnear the cochlear nerve (e.g., acoustic neuroma). \u2022 An endocrine evaluation measures hormone \nlevels in your blood or urine to detect abnormal\n \nlevels caused by pituitary tumors (e.g., Cushing\u2019s Disease). \u2022\n A visual field acuity test is performed by a \nneuro-ophthalmologist to detect vision loss and  \nmissing areas in your field of view. \u2022 A lumbar puncture (spinal tap) may be \nperformed to examine cerebrospinal fluid for tumor cells, proteins, infection, and blood. Imaging tests \n\u2022 Computed Tomography (CT) scan is a safe, \nnoninvasive test that uses an X-ray beam and a\n \ncomputer to make 2-dimensional images of the  \nbrain. Similar to an MRI, it views the brain in slices, layer-by-layer, taking a picture of each \nslice. A dye (contrast agent) may be injected \ninto your bloodstream. CT is especially useful \nfor viewing changes in bony structures. \u2022 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan is \na noninvasive test that uses a magnetic field \nand radiofrequency waves to give a detailed \nview of the soft tissues of the brain. It views \nthe brain 3-dimensionally in slices that can be \ntaken from the side or from the top as a cross-\nsection.", "metadata": {"source": "brain_tumors_ucni.pdf", "file_type": "pdf", "num_pages": 7, "creationdate": "D:20100301162453-05'00'", "author": "Tonya Hines", "creator": "Word: cgpdftops CUPS filter", "producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.2.0 (Macintosh)", "moddate": "D:20100301162519-05'00'", "title": "Microsoft Word - PE-BrainTumors_UCNI.doc", "medical_entities": {"diseases": ["cancer"], "procedures": ["biopsy", "surgery", "x-ray"], "anatomy": ["stomach", "brain", "bone", "muscle", "liver", "pituitary", "lung", "nerve"]}, "document_type": "clinical_note", "processing_timestamp": "2025-03-22T23:48:11.721892", "chunk_number": 2, "total_chunks": 10, "section": "sliding_window", "hierarchy_level": "sliding", "importance_score": 0.1855920114122682, "word_count": 701, "chunking_strategy": "hybrid", "previous_chunk_id": "d2a0b811-72b0-f95e-b301-471500000001", "next_chunk_id": "d2a0b811-72b0-f95e-b301-471500000003"}}, {"id": "d2a0b811-72b0-f95e-b301-471500000003", "content": "\u2022 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan is \na noninvasive test that uses a magnetic field \nand radiofrequency waves to give a detailed \nview of the soft tissues of the brain.

MRI is very useful to \nevaluate brain lesions and their effects on \nsurrounding brain (Fig. 3). Biopsy  \nIn some cases, if a diagnosis cannot be made \nclearly from the scans, a biopsy may be performed to determine what type of tumor is present. Biopsy  \nis a procedure to remove a small amount of tumor to be examined by a pathologist under a \nmicroscope. A biopsy can be taken as part of an \nopen surgical procedure to remove the tumor or as\n \na separate diagnostic procedure, known as a needle  \nbiopsy via a small hole drilled in the skull. A hollow  \nneedle is guided into the tumor and a tissue sample  \nis removed (Fig. 4). A stereotactic biopsy is like a needle biopsy but is performed with the use of a \nstereotactic head frame and a computer to precisely\n \nlocate the tumor and direct the needle. This more complex procedure is used for deep tumors in \ncritical locations. Benign            Malignant \n \nFigure 3. MRI scans of a benign and malignant brain \ntumor.

For \nexample, benign, slow growing tumors that are \nsmall and have few symptoms may be observed with routine MRI scans every year until their growth\n \nor symptoms necessitate surgery. Observation may be the best option for older patients with other \nhealth conditions. Medication  \nMedications are used to control some of the common side effects of brain tumors. \u2022 Corticosteroid medications, such as \ndexamethasone (Decadron), are prescribed to \nreduce swelling and inflammation around the \ntumor. Because steroid medications can cause \nstomach ulcers and gastric reflux, famotidine (Pepcid) or pantoprazole (Protonix) are \nprescribed to reduce the amount of acid \nproduced in the stomach. \u2022 Furosemide (Lasix) or mannitol (Osmitrol) may \nbe used to control edema and intracranial \npressure. \u2022 Anticonvulsant medications are used to prevent \nor control seizures. The most common ones \ninclude phenytoin (Dilantin), valproic acid \n(Depakote), carbamazepine\n (Tegretol), and \nlevetiracetam (Keppra). Surgery \nSurgery is the treatment of choice for brain tumors \nthat can be reached without causing significant \ninjury to vital parts of the brain (eloquent tissue). Surgery can help to refine the diagnosis, remove as \nmuch of the tumor as possible, and release \npressure within the skull caused by the tumor. A neurosurgeon performs a craniotomy to open the skull and remove the tumor. Sometimes only part \nof the tumor is removed if it is near critical areas of \nthe brain. A partial removal can still relieve \nsymptoms. Radiation or chemotherapy may be used\n \non the remaining tumor cells. Improvements in techniques, particularly image-\nguided surgery, intraoperative MRI/CT, and \nfunctional brain mapping have improved the surgeon\u2019s ability to precisely locate the tumor, \ndefine the tumor\u2019s borders, avoid injury to vital \nbrain areas, and confirm the amount of tumor \nremoval while in the operating room. Radiation \nRadiation therapy uses controlled high-energy rays to treat brain tumors. Radiation works by damaging \nthe DNA inside cells making them unable to divide \nand reproduce.

Adjunct  therapies  \n\u2022 Immunotherapy or biotherapy activates the \nimmune system (T-cells and antibodies) to \ndestroy cancer cells. Experimental research is \nexploring ways to prevent or treat cancer \nthrough vaccines. \u2022 Gene therapy uses viruses or other vectors to \nintroduce new genetic material into tumor cells. This experimental therapy can cause tumor cells to die or increase their susceptibility to \nother cancer therapies. \u2022 Hyperbaric oxygen uses oxygen at higher than \nnormal levels to promote wound healing and \nhelp fight infection. It may also improve the \ntumor\u2019s responsiveness to radiation and is \nbeing studied experimentally. Currently it is being used to help the body naturally remove \ndead tumor cells and treat radiation necrosis. Clinical trials \nClinical trials are research studies in which new \ntreatments\u2014drugs, diagnostics, procedures, and \nother therapies\u2014are tested in people to see if they are safe and effective. Research is always being \nconducted to improve the standard of medical care. Information about current clinical trials, including \neligibility, protocol, and locations, are found on the \nWeb. Studies can be sponsored by the National \nInstitutes of Health (see clinicaltrials.gov) as well as\n \nprivate industry and pharmaceutical companies \n(see www.centerwatch.com). Recovery & prevention \nSelf care \nYour primary care doctor and oncologist should discuss any home care needs with you and your \nfamily. Supportive measures vary according to your \nsymptoms. For example, canes or walkers can help \nthose having trouble walking. A plan of care to \naddress changes in mental status should be adapted to each patient\u2019s needs. Figure 5.

Rehabilitation Because brain tumors develop in parts of the brain \nthat control movement, speech, vision and thinking, \nrehabilitation may be a necessary part of recovery. Although the brain can sometimes heal itself after the trauma of treatment, it will take time and \npatience. A neuropsychologist can help patients \nevaluate changes caused by their brain tumor and \ndevelop a plan for rehabilitation. A neuropsych-\nological evaluation assesses the patient's emotional \nstate, daily behavior, cognitive (mental) abilities, \nand personality. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy may be helpful to \nimprove or correct lost functions. Recurrence \nHow well a tumor will respond to treatment, remain in remission, or recur after treatment depends on \nthe specific tumor type and location. A recurrent \ntumor may be a tumor that still persists after \ntreatment, one that grows back some time after \ntreatment destroyed it, or a new tumor that grows \nin the same place as the original one. When a brain tumor is in remission, the tumor cells \nhave stopped growing or multiplying. Periods of \nremission vary. In general, benign tumors recur \nless often than malignant ones. Since it is impossible to predict whether or when a \nparticular tumor may recur, lifelong monitoring with MRI or CT scans is essential for people treated for a \nbrain tumor, even a benign lesion. Follow-up scans \nmay be performed every 3 to 6 months or annually, \ndepending on the type of tumor you had.
