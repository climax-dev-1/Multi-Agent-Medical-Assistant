Shouip,\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) also known as simply diabetes, is a group of metabolic diseases in which there are high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period This high blood sugar produces the symptoms of frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. Untreated, diabetes can cause many complications. Acute complications include diabetic ketoacidosis and nonketotic hyperosmolar coma. Serious long-term complications include heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, foot ulcers and damage to\nthe eyes. Diabetes is due to either the pancreas not producing enough insulin, or the cells of the body not responding properly to the insulin produced. There are three main types of diabetes mellitus:\n\nType 1 DM results from the body's failure to produce enough insulin. This form was previously referred to as \"insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus\" (IDDM) or \"juvenile diabetes\". The cause is unknown\nType 2 DM begins with insulin resistance, a condition in which cells fail to respond to insulin properly. As the disease progresses a lack of insulin may also develop. This form was previously referred to as \"non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus\" (NIDDM) or \"adult-onset diabetes\". The primary cause is excessive body weight and not enough exercise. Gestational diabetes, is the third main form and occurs when pregnant women without a previous history of diabetes develop a high blood glucose level. Prevention and treatment involves a healthy diet, physical exercise, not using tobacco, and being a normal body weight. Blood pressure control and proper foot care are also important for people with the disease. Type 1 diabetes must be managed with insulin injections. Type 2 diabetes may be treated with medications with or without insulin. Insulin and some oral medications can cause low blood sugar. Weight loss surgery in those with obesity is an effective measure in those with type 2 DM. Gestational diabetes usually resolves after the birth of the baby. Signs and symptoms:\n\nThe classic symptoms of untreated diabetes are weight loss, polyuria (frequent urination), polydipsia (increased thirst), and polyphagia (increased hunger).", "metadata": {"source": "diabetes.pdf", "file_type": "pdf", "has_tables": false, "table_count": 0, "has_images": false, "image_count": 0, "filetype": "application/pdf", "languages": ["eng"], "last_modified": "2025-03-18T00:35:24", "page_number": 1, "orig_elements": "[<unstructured.documents.elements.NarrativeText object at 0x000001A3CFF8FAD0>, <unstructured.documents.elements.Title object at 0x000001A3C48D3E50>, <unstructured.documents.elements.NarrativeText object at 0x000001A3DB978B50>, <unstructured.documents.elements.NarrativeText object at 0x000001A3D09A1890>, <unstructured.documents.elements.Title object at 0x000001A3C6562F50>, <unstructured.documents.elements.Title object at 0x000001A3D0B81390>, <unstructured.documents.elements.Text object at 0x000001A3D9E17C50>, <unstructured.documents.elements.NarrativeText object at 0x000001A3D09A3590>]", "_known_field_names": "frozenset({'url', 'image_path', 'bcc_recipient', 'subject', 'image_mime_type', 'emphasized_text_tags', 'attached_to_filename', 'file_directory', 'link_start_indexes', 'email_message_id', 'key_value_pairs', 'languages', 'link_urls', 'page_number', 'is_continuation', 'parent_id', 'sent_from', 'emphasized_text_contents', 'coordinates', 'detection_class_prob', 'filename', 'link_texts', 'sent_to', 'detection_origin', 'header_footer_type', 'cc_recipient', 'filetype', 'table_as_cells', 'image_base64', 'links', 'data_source', 'page_name', 'last_modified', 'signature', 'text_as_html', 'category_depth', 'orig_elements'})", "file_directory": "data\\raw", "filename": "diabetes.pdf", "is_continuation": true, "id": "b6c3ca4b-9b5e-4d61-9459-e95b35eb05e9", "medical_entities": {"diseases": ["stroke", "diabetes", "heart disease", "obesity", "chronic kidney disease"], "medications": ["aspirin", "insulin"], "procedures": ["surgery"], "anatomy": ["liver", "muscle", "skin", "nerve", "artery", "pancreas", "kidney", "heart"]}, "document_type": "clinical_note", "processing_timestamp": "2025-04-07T21:33:05.711314", "chunk_number": 0, "total_chunks": 7, "section": "sliding_window", "hierarchy_level": "sliding", "importance_score": 0.5284222737819025, "word_count": 431, "chunking_strategy": "hybrid", "next_chunk_id": "655ad15b-b237-a57f-d75d-9acc00000001"}}, {"id": "655ad15b-b237-a57f-d75d-9acc00000001", "content": "Gestational diabetes usually resolves after the birth of the baby.

Unlike type 2 diabetes, the onset of type 1 diabetes is unrelated to lifestyle. Type 2:\n\nType 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin resistance, which may be combined with relatively reduced insulin secretion. [5] The defective responsiveness of body tissues to insulin is believed to involve the insulin receptor. However, the specific defects are not known. Diabetes mellitus cases due to a known defect are classified separately. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type. In the early stage of type 2, the predominant abnormality is reduced insulin sensitivity. At this stage, hyperglycemia can be reversed by a variety of measures and medications that improve insulin sensitivity or reduce glucose production by the liver. Type 2 diabetes is due primarily to lifestyle factors and genetics. [27] A number of lifestyle factors are known to be important to the development of type 2 diabetes, including obesity (defined by a body mass index of greater than thirty), lack of physical activity, poor diet, stress, and urbanization. [11] Excess body fat is associated with 30% of cases in those of Chinese and Japanese descent, 60-80% of cases in those of European and African descent, and 100% of Pima Indians and Pacific\nIslanders. [5] Those who are not obese often have a high waist\u2013hip ratio. [5]\nDietary factors also influence the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks in excess is associated with an increased risk. [28][29] The type of fats in the diet is also important, with saturated fats and trans fatty acids increasing the risk and polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat decreasing the risk. [27] Eating lots of white rice appears to also play a role in increasing risk. [30] A lack of exercise is believed to cause 7% of cases.

It occurs in about 2-10% of all pregnancies and may improve or disappear after delivery. [32] However, after pregnancy approximately 5-10% of women with gestational diabetes are found to have diabetes mellitus, most commonly type 2. [32] Gestational diabetes is fully treatable, but requires careful medical supervision throughout\nthe pregnancy. Management may include dietary changes, blood glucose monitoring, and in some cases insulin may be required. Though it may be transient, untreated gestational diabetes can damage the health of the fetus or mother. Risks to the baby include macrosomia (high birth weight), congenital cardiac and central nervous system anomalies, and skeletal muscle malformations. Increased fetal insulin may inhibit fetal surfactant production and cause respiratory distress syndrome. Hyperbilirubinemia may result from red blood cell destruction. In severe cases, perinatal death may occur, most commonly as a result of poor\nplacental perfusion due to vascular impairment. Labor induction may be indicated with decreased placental function. A Caesarean section may be performed if there is marked fetal distress or an increased risk of injury associated with macrosomia, such as shoulder dystocia. Diagnosis:\n\nDiabetes mellitus is characterized by recurrent or persistent hyperglycemia, and is diagnosed by demonstrating any one of the following:[33]\n\nFasting plasma glucose level \u2265 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl)\n\nPlasma glucose \u2265 11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl) two hours after a 75 g oral glucose load as in a glucose tolerance test\n\nSymptoms of hyperglycemia and casual plasma glucose \u2265 11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl)\nBlood Test Levels for Diagnosis of Diabetes and Prediabetes Fasting Plasma| Oral Glucose Glucose Tolerance Test (mg/dL) (mg/dL) _ [toma | seows | sot | stotioe Definitions mg = milligram, dl, = deciliter For all three tests, within the prediabetes range, the higher the test result, the greater the risk of diabetes. A positive result, in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, should be confirmed by a repeat of any of the above methods on a different day. It is preferable to measure a fasting glucose level because of the ease of measurement and the considerable time commitment of formal glucose tolerance testing, which takes two hours to complete and offers no prognostic advantage over the fasting test. [43] According to the current definition, two fasting glucose measurements above 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l)\nis considered diagnostic for diabetes mellitus. Prevention:\nThere is no known preventive measure for type 1 diabetes. [3] Type 2 diabetes can often be prevented by a person being a normal body weight , phy sical exercise, and following a healthy diet Dietary changes known to be effective in helping to prevent diabetes include a diet rich in whole grains and fiber , and choosing good fats, such as polyunsaturated fats found in nuts, vegetable oils, and fish. [48] Limiting sugary beverages and eating less red meat and other sources of saturated fat can\nalso help in the preventio n of diabetes. [48] Active smoking is also associated with an increased risk of diabetes, so smoking cessation can be an important preventive measure as well. Management:\n\nDiabetes mellitus is a chronic disease, for which there is no known cure except in very specific situations. Management concentrates on keeping blood sugar levels as close to normal (\"euglycemia\") as possible, without causing hypoglycemia. This can usually be accomplished with diet, exercise, and use of appropriate medications (insulin in the case of type 1 diabetes; oral medications, as well as possibly insulin, in type 2 diabetes). Learning about the disease and actively participating in the treatment is vital for people with diabetes, since the complications of diabetes are far less common and less severe in people who have well-managed blood sugar levels.

[50][51] The goal of treatment is an HbA1C level of 6.5%, but should not be lower than that, and may be set higher. [52] Attention is also paid to other health problems that may accelerate the deleterious effects of diabetes. These include smoking, elevated cholesterol\nlevels, obesity, high blood pressure, and lack of regular exercise. [52] Specialised footwear is widely used to reduce the risk of ulceration, or re-ulceration, in at-risk diabetic feet. Evidence for the efficacy of this remains equivocal, however. [53]\nLifestyle:\n\nPeople with diabetes can benefit from education about the disease and treatment, good nutrition to achieve a normal body weight, and sensible exercise, with the goal of keeping both short - term and long - term blood glucose levels within acceptable bounds . In addition, given the associated higher risks of cardiovascular disease, lifestyle modifications are recommended to control blood pressure\n\nMedications:\nMetformin is generally recommended as a first line treatment for type 2 diabetes, as there is good evidence that it decreases mortality. [55] Routine use of aspirin, however, has not been found to improve outcomes in uncomplicated diabetes. [56] Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) improve outcomes in those with DM while the similar medications angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) do not. [57]\nType 1 diabetes is typically treated with a combinations of regular and NPH insulin, or synthetic insulin analogs. When insulin is used in type 2 diabetes, a long-acting formulation is usually added initially, while continuing oral medications. [55] Doses of insulin are then increased to effect. [55]\n\nIn those with diabetes some recommend blood pressure levels below 120/80 mmHg;[58][59] however, evidence only supports less than or equal to somewhere between 140/90 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg.
