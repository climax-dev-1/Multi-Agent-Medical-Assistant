Shouip, Diabetes mellitus (DM) also known as simply diabetes , is a group of metabolic diseases in which there are high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period This high blood sugar produces the symptoms of frequent urination , increased thirst , and increased hunger . Untreated, diabetes can cause many complications. Acute complications include diabetic ketoacidosis and nonketotic hyperosmolar coma . Serious long-term complications include heart disease , stroke , kidney failure , foot ulcers and damage to the eyes . Diabetes is due to either the pancreas not producing enough insulin , or the cells of the body not responding properly to the insulin produced. There are three main types of diabetes mellitus: \uf0b7Type 1 DM results from the body's failure to produce enough insulin. This form was previously referred to as \"insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus\" (IDDM) or \"juvenile diabetes\". The cause is unknown \uf0b7Type 2 DM begins with insulin resistance , a condition in which cells fail to respond to insulin properly. As the disease progresses a lack of insulin may also develop. This form was previously referred to as \"non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus\" (NIDDM) or \"adult-onset diabetes\". The primary cause is excessive body weight and not enough exercise. \uf0b7Gestational diabetes , is the third main form and occurs when pregnant women without a previous history of diabetes develop a high blood glucose level. Prevention and treatment involves a healthy diet , physical exercise , not using tobacco , and being a normal body weight . Blood pressure control and proper foot care are also important for people with the disease. Type 1 diabetes must be managed with insulin injections. Type 2 diabetes may be treated with medications with or without insulin. Insulin and some oral medications can cause low blood sugar .Weight loss surgery in those with obesity is an effective measure in those with type 2 DM. Gestational diabetes usually resolves after the birth of the baby. Signs and symptoms: The classic symptoms of untreated diabetes are weight loss, polyuria (frequent urination), polydipsia (increased thirst), and polyphagia (increased hunger).[17] --- Page 3 --- Symptoms may develop rapidly (weeks or months) in type usually develop much more slowly and may be subtle or absent in type Several other signs and symptoms can mark the onset of diabetes, a not specific to the disease.

Diabetes doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease and about 75% of deaths in diabetics are due to coronary artery disease. Other \"macrovascular\" diseases are stroke , and peripheral vascular disease . The primary microvascular complications of diabetes include damage to the eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Damage to the eyes, known as diabetic retinopathy , is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina of the eye, and can result in gradual vision loss and potentially blindness. Damage to the kidneys, known as diabetic nephropathy , can lead to tissue scarring, urine protein loss, and eventually chronic kidney disease , sometimes requiring dialysis or kidney transplant Damage to the nerves of the body, known as diabetic neuropathy , is the most common complication of diabetes. The symptoms can include numbness, tingling, pain, and altered pain sensation, which can lead to damage to the skin. Diabetes-related foot problems (such as diabetic foot ulcers ) may occur, and can be difficult to treat, occasionally requiring amputation . Additionally, proximal diabetic neuropathy causes painful muscle wasting and weakness. There is a link between cognitive deficit and diabetes. Compared to those without diabetes, those with the disease have a 1.2 to 1.5-fold greater rate of decline in cognitive function. Causes : Diabetes mellitus is classified into four broad categories: type 1 , type 2 , gestational diabetes , and \"other specific types\". The \"other specific types\" are a collection of a few dozen individual causes. The term \"diabetes\", without qualification, usually refers to diabetes mellitus. --- Page 5 --- Type 1 : Type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterized by loss of the insulin the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, leading to insulin deficiency.

Unlike type 2 diabetes, the onset of type 1 --- Page 6 --- Type 2: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin resistance , which may be combined with relatively reduced insulin secretion.[5]The defective responsiveness of body tissues to insulin is believed to involve the insulin receptor . However, the specific defects are not known. Diabetes mellitus cases due to a known defect are classified separately. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type. In the early stage of type 2, the predominant abnormality is reduced insulin sensitivity. At this stage, hyperglycemia can be reversed by a variety of measures and medications that improve insulin sensitivity or reduce glucose production by the liver. Type 2 diabetes is due primarily to lifestyle factors and genetics.[27]A number of lifestyle factors are known to be important to the development of type 2 diabetes, including obesity (defined by a body mass index of greater than thirty), lack of physical activity, poor diet, stress, and urbanization .[11]Excess body fat is associated with 30% of cases in those of Chinese and Japanese descent, 60-80% of cases in those of European and African descent, and 100% of Pima Indians and Pacific Islanders.[5] Those who are not obese often have a high waist\u2013hip ratio .[5] Dietary factors also influence the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Consumption of sugar -sweetened drinks in excess is associated with an increased risk.[28][29]The type of fatsin the diet is also important, with saturated fats and trans fatty acids increasing the risk and polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat decreasing the risk.[27]Eating lots of white rice appears to also play a role in increasing risk.[30]A lack of exercise is believed to cause 7% of cases.[3 Gestational diabetes: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) resembles type 2 diabetes in several respects, involving a combination of relatively inadequate insulin secretion and responsiveness. It occurs in about 2-10% of all pregnancies and may improve or disappear after delivery.[32]However, after pregnancy approximately 5-10% of women with gestational diabetes are found to have diabetes mellitus, most commonly type 2.[32] Gestational diabetes is fully treatable, but requires careful medical supervision throughout the pregnancy. Management may include dietary changes, blood glucose monitoring, and in some cases insulin may be required. --- Page 7 --- Though it may be transient, untreated gestational diabetes can damage the health of the fetus or mother. Risks to the baby include macrosomia (high birth weight), congenital cardiac and central nervous system anomalies, and skeletal muscle malformations. Increased fetal insulin may inhibit fetal surfactant production and cause respiratory distress syndrome . Hyperbilirubinemia may result from red blood cell destruction. In severe cases, perinatal death may occur, most commonly as a result of poor placental perfusion due to vascular impairment. Labor induction may be indicated with decreased placental function.

Diagnosis: Diabetes mellitus is characterized by recurrent or persistent hyperglycemia, and is diagnosed by demonstrating any one of the following:[33] \uf0b7Fasting plasma glucose level \u22657.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) \uf0b7Plasma glucose \u226511.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl) two hours after a 75 g oral glucose load as in a glucose tolerance test \uf0b7Symptoms of hyperglycemia and casual plasma glucose \u226511.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl) --- Page 8 --- A positive result, in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, should be confirmed by a repeat of any of the above methods on a different day. It is preferable to measure a fasting glucose level because of the ease of measurement and the considerable time commitment of formal glucose tolerance testing, which takes two hours to complete and offers no prognostic advantage over the fasting test.[43]According to the current definition, two fasting glucose measurements above 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l) is considered diagnostic for diabetes mellitus.

Management: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease , for which there is no known cure except in very specific situations. Management concentrates on keeping blood sugar levels as close to normal (\"euglycemia\") as possible, without causing hypoglycemia. This can usually be accomplished with diet, exercise, and use of appropriate medications (insulin in the case of type 1 diabetes; oral medications, as well as possibly insulin, in type 2 diabetes). --- Page 9 --- Learning about the disease and actively participating in the treatment is vital for people with diabetes, since the complications of diabetes are far less common and less severe in people who have well-managed blood sugar levels.[50][51]The goal of treatment is an HbA1C level of 6.5%, but should not be lower than that, and may be set higher.[52]Attention is also paid to other health problems that may accelerate the deleterious effects of diabetes. These include smoking , elevated cholesterol levels, obesity , high blood pressure , and lack of regular exercise .[52]Specialised footwear is widely used to reduce the risk of ulceration, or re-ulceration, in at-risk diabetic feet.

When insulin is used in type 2 diabetes, a long-acting formulation is usually added initially, while continuing oral medications.[55]Doses of insulin are then increased to effect.[55] In those with diabetes some recommend blood pressure levels below 120/80 mmHg;[58][59]however, evidence only supports less than or equal to somewhere between 140/90 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg. --- Page 10 --- References: \uf0b7 ^\"Diabetes Blue Circle Symbol\" .
