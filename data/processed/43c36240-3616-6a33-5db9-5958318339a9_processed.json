Shouip,\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) also known as simply diabetes , is a group of metabolic \ndiseases in which there are high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period This high \nblood sugar produces the symptoms of frequent urination , increased thirst , and \nincreased hunger . Untreated, diabetes can cause many complications. Acute\ncomplications include diabetic ketoacidosis and nonketotic hyperosmolar coma . Serious long-term complications include heart disease , stroke , kidney failure , foot \nulcers and damage to the eyes . Diabetes is due to either the pancreas not producing enough insulin , or the cells of the \nbody not responding properly to the insulin produced. There are three main types of \ndiabetes mellitus:\n\uf0b7Type 1 DM results from the body's failure to produce enough insulin. This \nform was previously referred to as \"insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus\" \n(IDDM) or \"juvenile diabetes\". The cause is unknown \n\uf0b7Type 2 DM begins with insulin resistance , a condition in which cells fail to \nrespond to insulin properly. As the disease progresses a lack of insulin may \nalso develop. This form was previously referred to as \"non insulin-dependent \ndiabetes mellitus\" (NIDDM) or \"adult-onset diabetes\". The primary cause is \nexcessive body weight and not enough exercise. \uf0b7Gestational diabetes , is the third main form and occurs when pregnant women \nwithout a previous history of diabetes develop a high blood glucose level. Prevention and treatment involves a healthy diet , physical exercise , not using tobacco , \nand being a normal body weight . Blood pressure control and proper foot care are also \nimportant for people with the disease. Type 1 diabetes must be managed with insulin\ninjections. Type 2 diabetes may be treated with medications with or without insulin. Insulin and some oral medications can cause low blood sugar .Weight loss surgery in \nthose with obesity is an effective measure in those with type 2 DM. Gestational \ndiabetes usually resolves after the birth of the baby. Signs and symptoms: \nThe classic symptoms of untreated diabetes are weight loss, polyuria (frequent \nurination), polydipsia (increased thirst), and polyphagia (increased hunger).

Type 2 diabetes is the most common type. In the early stage of type 2, the predominant abnormality is reduced insulin \nsensitivity. At this stage, hyperglycemia can be reversed by a variety of measures and \nmedications that improve insulin sensitivity or reduce glucose production by the liver. Type 2 diabetes is due primarily to lifestyle factors and genetics. [27]A number of \nlifestyle factors are known to be important to the development of type 2 diabetes, \nincluding obesity (defined by a body mass index of greater than thirty), lack of \nphysical activity, poor diet, stress, and urbanization . [11]Excess body fat is associated \nwith 30% of cases in those of Chinese and Japanese descent, 60-80% of cases in those \nof European and African descent, and 100% of Pima Indians and Pacific Islanders. [5]\nThose who are not obese often have a high waist\u2013hip ratio . [5]\nDietary factors also influence the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Consumption of \nsugar -sweetened drinks in excess is associated with an increased risk. [28][29]The type \nof fatsin the diet is also important, with saturated fats and trans fatty acids increasing \nthe risk and polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat decreasing the risk. [27]Eating \nlots of white rice appears to also play a role in increasing risk. [30]A lack of exercise is \nbelieved to cause 7% of cases. [3\nGestational diabetes:\nGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) resembles type 2 diabetes in several respects, \ninvolving a combination of relatively inadequate insulin secretion and responsiveness. It occurs in about 2-10% of all pregnancies and may improve or disappear after \ndelivery. [32]However, after pregnancy approximately 5-10% of women with \ngestational diabetes are found to have diabetes mellitus, most commonly type 2. [32]\nGestational diabetes is fully treatable, but requires careful medical supervision \nthroughout the pregnancy. Management may include dietary changes, blood glucose \nmonitoring, and in some cases insulin may be required. --- Page 7 ---\nThough it may be transient, untreated gestational diabetes can damage the health of \nthe fetus or mother. Risks to the baby include macrosomia (high birth weight), \ncongenital cardiac and central nervous system anomalies, and skeletal muscle \nmalformations. Increased fetal insulin may inhibit fetal surfactant production and \ncause respiratory distress syndrome . Hyperbilirubinemia may result from red blood \ncell destruction. In severe cases, perinatal death may occur, most commonly as a \nresult of poor placental perfusion due to vascular impairment. Labor induction may be \nindicated with decreased placental function.

It is preferable to measure \na fasting glucose level because of the ease of measurement and the considerable time \ncommitment of formal glucose tolerance testing, which takes two hours to complete \nand offers no prognostic advantage over the fasting test. [43]According to the current \ndefinition, two fasting glucose measurements above 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l) is \nconsidered diagnostic for diabetes mellitus.

Management:\nDiabetes mellitus is a chronic disease , for which there is no known cure except in very \nspecific situations. Management concentrates on keeping blood sugar levels as close \nto normal (\"euglycemia\") as possible, without causing hypoglycemia. This can \nusually be accomplished with diet, exercise, and use of appropriate medications \n(insulin in the case of type 1 diabetes; oral medications, as well as possibly insulin, in \ntype 2 diabetes). --- Page 9 ---\nLearning about the disease and actively participating in the treatment is vital for \npeople with diabetes, since the complications of diabetes are far less common and less \nsevere in people who have well-managed blood sugar levels. [50][51]The goal of \ntreatment is an HbA1C level of 6.5%, but should not be lower than that, and may be \nset higher. [52]Attention is also paid to other health problems that may accelerate the \ndeleterious effects of diabetes. These include smoking , elevated cholesterol levels, \nobesity , high blood pressure , and lack of regular exercise . [52]Specialised footwear is \nwidely used to reduce the risk of ulceration, or re-ulceration, in at-risk diabetic feet. Evidence for the efficacy of this remains equivocal, however.
